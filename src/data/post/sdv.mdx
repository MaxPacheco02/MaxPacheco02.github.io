This is my other favorite project that I got to work on after classes at my robotics student group in college: A self driving golf cart meant to give autonomous rides to tourists on campus, and provide an interactive and unique experience of our university. This is the biggest and most challenging project Iâ€™ve worked on, strictly working in the software area, where I implemented some controllers, and mainly worked on the integration of several ROS 2 nodes related to the perception, electronics, and localization areas, preparation for testing on Gazebo Sim, and safety functionalities.

For this project, due to the extensive and laborious work that it involved, I received an internship along with 3 other teammates, as part of the second generation of interns from ZF, our project sponsor, which helped funding part of the project for components and tools, as well as a salary for each of us interns, which also served as a reaffirmation to our work and its significance and importance.
