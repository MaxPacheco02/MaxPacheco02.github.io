Here are some projects that I like that I did in college as class projects.

## Chicken Run

[Check out the repository!](https://github.com/MaxPacheco02/PollitosEnFuga/tree/main)

Quick class mapping challenge to identify and track the trajectory of several chickens from a video taken from our professor on campus. First, for the mapping/localization part, I tried to directly apply the ORB-SLAM algorithm, but it did not give good results because the video was very unstable, and the camera’s intrinsics were unknown; so using computer vision, I implemented my own algorithm:

I started by detecting strong line features in each frame using Canny edge detection followed by a Hough Transform. These lines were clustered into horizontal and vertical groups to form a grid, which I tracked over time by aligning it with the grid from previous frames. This gave me a stable, persistent reference frame.

On top of that, I used a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect the chickens in each frame. For each detection, I computed the midpoint of the bounding box and mapped it to the closest region of the dynamic grid, estimating their real-world position relative to the scene.

## Follower Drone

For this quick class mini-project I interfaced (in Python) the DJI’s Tello mini drone, and used its camera to follow and go through an obstacle on our school’s Multi-Robot Systems Laboratory.

## Cable driven leg mechanism

Quick class mini-project assignment where I designed and 3D printed a leg mechanism inspired in MABEL from the University of Michigan.

## System Validation and Valve Monitoring Project using an STM32 (June, 2023)

[Check out the repository!](https://github.com/MaxPacheco02/SystemOnChip_501)

Group class project for the "System-on-Chip Design" class using a NUCLEO-STM32 board with a FreeRTOS implementation. Valve pressure and flow data from sensors was transmitted via UART to another device for display, and valve opening and closing with relays and timers.
